* **config:** `manifest.dash.defaultPresentationDelay` has been replaced by `manifest.defaultPresentationDelay` (deprecated in v3.0.0)
* **config:** Configuration of factories should be plain factory functions, not constructors; these will not be invoked with `new` (deprecated in v3.1.0)

* **manifest:** `shaka.media.SegmentIndex.prototype.merge()` has become private; use `mergeAndEvict()` instead (deprecated in v3.2.0)
* **plugin:** `AbrManager` plugins must implement the `playbackRateChanged()` method (deprecated in v3.0.0)
* **plugin:** `shaka.extern.Cue.prototype.spacer` has been replaced by the more clearly-named `lineBreak` (deprecated in v3.1.0)
* **plugin:** `IUIElement` plugins must have a `release()` method (not `destroy()`) (deprecated in v3.0.0)

    - https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-player/issues/1260
  - Text parser plugins now take a nullable segmentStart in TextContext.  All
    application-specific text-parsing plugins MUST be updated.
  - Text-parsing plugins that produce region information must do so with the new
    CueRegion class.  Any application-specific text-parsing plugins that produce
    region information MUST be updated.
  - TextDisplayer plugins that handle region information must do so with the new
    CueRegion interface.  Any application-specific TextDisplayer plugins that
    handle region information MUST be updated.

    use certain PresentationTimeline methods MUST be updated:
    - `setAvailabilityStart()` was renamed to `setUserSeekStart()`.

Deprecated:
  - The following methods on Player are deprecated.  They will be removed in
    v1.4.0:
    - getCurrentResolution() (replace with video.videoWidth & video.videoHeight)
    - getCurrentTime()/seek() (replace with video.currentTime)
    - getDuration() (replace with video.duration)
    - getMuted()/setMuted() (replace with video.muted)
